# This is a very simple project but I am trying to tackle coding one step at a time. 

print("Welcome to Tips")

bill = float(input("What is the total of the bill?: $"))

tip = int(input("What percentage would you like to tip? 15, 18, or 20? "))

people = int(input("How many people are splitting the bill? "))

tip_percent = tip / 100

total_tip_amount = bill * tip_percent

total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount

bill_per_person = total_bill / people

final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)

final_amount = "{:.2f}".format(bill_per_person)

print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
